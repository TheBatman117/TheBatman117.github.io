      <p>
        NightCafe has added a new speed-first option: <strong>Flux 2 Klein 9B Fast</strong>. If you’re the kind of person who gets
        angry waiting for generations (so… anyone with a pulse), this model is built around one core idea:
        <em>make iteration fast enough that “trying again” is a normal part of the workflow</em>, not a punishment.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s new</h2>
      <p>
        “Klein” is <strong>Black Forest Labs’</strong> compact Flux 2 family designed for low-latency use cases. The official framing
        positions Flux 2 Klein as unifying <strong>image generation</strong> and <strong>image editing</strong> in one model, with
        near-instant style/iteration behavior on supported hardware for certain variants.
      </p>
      <p>
        NightCafe’s “Fast” label matters because it’s basically a promise: this is meant for rapid prompt iteration, quick variations,
        and edit-style workflows where you keep a concept but change specifics. In other words: fewer “one perfect prompt” fantasies,
        more “small changes until it’s right.”
      </p>

      <h2>Why it matters for real creators</h2>
      <p>
        Most people don’t need a model that’s 2% better if it’s 3× slower. What they need is speed that changes behavior: you generate
        more variants, compare them, and lock in consistent styles instead of gambling once and calling it “art direction.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Faster cycles are also a big deal for anything multi-scene: character consistency, themed sets, storyboards, thumbnails, and
        “I need three versions before I pick one” work.
      </p>

      <h2>How I’d use it in NightCafe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thumbnail/cover exploration:</strong> generate 8–20 quick versions, then switch to a higher-fidelity model only after the composition is nailed.</li>
        <li><strong>Style locking:</strong> keep the same prompt skeleton and iterate on small changes (lighting, palette, camera angle) until the “look” is repeatable.</li>
        <li><strong>Edit workflows:</strong> start from a strong image, then do targeted changes (mood, props, environment cues) instead of regenerating from scratch.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My take</h2>
      <p>
        This is the kind of update that sounds boring until you use it for an hour. Speed is the difference between “cool demo” and
        “tool you’ll actually open again tomorrow.” If Flux 2 Klein 9B Fast holds up in quality while staying quick, it pushes NightCafe
        further into being a real creative workspace, not just a roulette wheel with pretty pictures.
      </p>

          Note: If NightCafe’s exact “Fast” label is UI-based and changes over time, the most stable verification is the
