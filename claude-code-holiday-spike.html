      <h2>Claude Code’s “holiday spike” made vibe coding mainstream (and Anthropic leaned into it)</h2>
      <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>
        During the holiday break, Anthropic’s Claude Code advanced from a simple “cool terminal toy” to
        “oh… this is changing workflows” levels of adoption. The Applied AI Observer pinned the surge to
        late December 2025, assisted along the way by Anthropic doubling usage limits as a holiday gift
        and a wave of developers sharing surprisingly capable results. The moment it went actually viral
        was after one of Google’s engineers, Jaana Dogan posted that Claude Code was able to generate a
        prototype of something her team had spent a year building, in about an hour (she later clarified
        it was a toy version, but still a useful starting point).

        Anthropic then shipped over Claude Cowork as a research preview: an agent inside Claude’s macOS
        app (for Claude Max subscribers) that can work across your local folders and connect to services
        like Asana and Notion. Anthropic also warned about the obvious risk: if you give an agent file
        access and your instructions are mushy, it can absolutely delete the wrong thing. Humans do that
        too, but they usually feel bad afterward.

        My take on it is that the bottleneck is sliding from a “can you implement” to “can you specify and
        judge.” It works bloody great if you’re precise. But, just as with anything else; if you’re vague,
        the AI will faithfully build your vagueness into software, which is the most human tradition
        imaginable.
