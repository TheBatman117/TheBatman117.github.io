      <h2>Cursor pushes agent workflows into the terminal with CLI Agent Modes + Cloud Handoff</h2>
      <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>
        Cursor has been acting less like “an AI code editor” and more like “a coordination layer for agents.”
        The newest move is bringing agent modes to the Cursor CLI, so you can do the same plan-first workflow
        you’d use in the editor, but from a terminal session. Their changelog calls out a Plan mode that prompts
        you to outline the approach before it starts changing files, launched via <code>/plan</code> or
        <code>--mode=plan</code>, plus “Cloud Handoff” to move work between environments without losing the thread.
      </p>

      <p>
        This matters because a lot of real-world coding is still terminal-native: SSH boxes, containers, quick repo
        surgery, CI debugging, and “I swear this will be a small change” moments. A CLI agent that can plan, execute,
        and then hand off the state cleanly is Cursor admitting what everyone already knows: the IDE isn’t the only
        battlefield.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that this is a modern-day AI version of the US and Russia’s arms race behind all the flashy “agents”
        talk. Because the winner won’t just have a smart model. They’ll have the most flawless and least-friction loop
        for: plan → modify → test → handoff → review, and Cursor is trying to make that loop feel inevitable.
