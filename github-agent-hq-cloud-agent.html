      <h2>GitHub turns into “mission control” for multiple coding agents (Agent HQ + Cloud Agent previews)</h2>
      <p class="date">January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>
        GitHub is increasingly treating AI help as an ecosystem, not a single assistant. The Verge reported GitHub
        rolling out “Agent HQ,” a hub where Copilot subscribers can access and manage multiple coding agents,
        including third-party options like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic Claude, Google Jules, and Devin, with a
        “mission control” style dashboard to run agents in parallel and compare outputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, GitHub keeps pushing AI deeper into the production pipeline: Copilot code review is
        generally available (so you can offload basic review passes to an agent), and Visual Studio 2026 release
        notes mention a “GitHub Cloud Agent” preview for delegating multi-file chores like refactors and doc updates,
        then reviewing the changes later.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe that GitHub is aiming to be the control plane for agentic development, where your repo, PRs,
        reviews, and automation live. While that’s convenient, to some people (especially those who don’t like AI),
        it can also be a little terrifying, because it centralizes both productivity and risk in one place. Just
        like how everything else in our software history suggests, we will choose convenience, then act surprised
        about the risk later.
